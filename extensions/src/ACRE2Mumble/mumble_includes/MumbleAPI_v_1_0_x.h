    //
    // All functions that take in a connection as a paremeter may only be called **after** the connection
    // has finished synchronizing. The only exception from this is isConnectionSynchronized.
    //
    // Strings returned by the API are UTF-8 encoded
    // Strings passed to the API are expected to be UTF-8 encoded
    //
    // All API functions are synchronized and will be executed in Mumble's "main thread" from which most plugin
    // callbacks are called as well. Note however that an API call is BLOCKING if invoked from a different
    // thread. This means that they can cause deadlocks if used without caution. An example that will lead
    // to a deadlock is:
    // - plugin callback gets called from the main thread
    // - callback messages a separate thread to do something and waits for the action to have completed
    // - Separate thread calls an API function
    // - The function blocks and waits to be executed in the main thread which is currently blocked waiting
    // - deadlock

## Overview

This documentation is built using [Jekyll Documentation Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) ([commit](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll/commit/04a70f0e23fdd42de9963243f9e932a67770cfe4)), all the theme documentation and tutorials are appliccable to ACRE2's documentation, with few changes:
- Added nicer keyboard tags styling
- Merged news pages into main part
- Removed tooltips functionality
- Removed multi-project functionality

## Guidelines

- A line between each entry like above.
    - This is especially necessary for the kramdown markup syntax. Kramdown needs a line break between each block level element (paragraphs, lists, codeblocks, etc.)
- Use `ACRE2` instead of `ACRE 2`.
- Remove each entry that is not used.
- Don't forget to say what you're going to work on on Slack.
- Keybinds in ```<kbd>keyboard tags</kbd>``` (eg. <kbd>⇧&nbsp;Shift</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>).
- Keywords in ````backticks````.
- Capitals at the start of a sentence and `.` at the end.
- Verify everything in-game-

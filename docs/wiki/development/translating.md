## Guide

This page describes in short how you can help translating ACRE2 into your language.

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account create one at [http://github.com](http://github.com)
2. Open the ACRE2 repository at [https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2](https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2)
3. In the top right corner press the `Fork` button
4. You are being redirected to your personal fork, a version that is hosted on your GitHub account (it says `yourUsername/acre2`)
5. Clone that fork to your PC (There are a lot of tools and tutorials how to do this (e.g. [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com)))
6. Download [tabler](https://github.com/bux578/tabler/releases) and extract it somewhere
7. Open the `tabler.exe` and in the menu click `File > Open language files`
8. Point tabler to the cloned ACRE2 directory
9. Start translating
10. When done go to the menu and click `File > Save language files`
11. Commit your changes to your local cloned repository
12. Sync (Push) your commit(s) to your fork
13. Create a Pull Request for your changes

(The last three steps require some git knowledge, but there are a lot of tutorials out there)

title: Translating

## Overview

This page describes how to help in translating ACRE2 to different languages. Most of the things can be translated, however radio dialogs are not one of them, as they require precise positioning and sizing to correctly fit.

## Guide

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account create one at [http://github.com](http://github.com)
2. Open the ACRE2 repository at [https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2](https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2)
3. In the top right corner press the `Fork` button
4. You are being redirected to your personal fork, a version that is hosted on your GitHub account (it says `yourUsername/acre2`)
5. Clone that fork to your PC (There are a lot of tools and tutorials how to do this (e.g. [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com)))
6. Download [tabler](https://github.com/bux578/tabler/releases) and extract it somewhere
7. Open the `tabler.exe` and in the menu click `File > Open language files`
8. Point tabler to the cloned ACRE2 directory
9. Start translating
10. When done go to the menu and click `File > Save language files`
11. Commit your changes to your local cloned repository
12. Sync (Push) your commit(s) to your fork
13. Create a Pull Request for your changes

(The last three steps require some git knowledge, but there are a lot of tutorials out there)

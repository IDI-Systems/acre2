title: Ground Spike Antenna
---

The GSA is a radio antenna which can be deployed in the field which allows for any radio to be connected. Doing so will increase the transmit power to 20 W and improve reception due to the increased height of the antenna, generally resulting in an improved quality over range.

The `ACRE_VHF30108SPIKE` (VHF30108 GS) can have the `ACRE_VHF30108MAST` (VHF30108 Mast) mounted on afterwards which is the equivalent of using the `ACRE_VHF30108` (VHF30108 GSM).

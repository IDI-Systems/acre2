- Navigate to your Arma 3 installation folder.
- Delete any current `@acre2` folder and then paste in the `@acre2` folder you from the extracted `.zip`.
- Create a new shortcut or edit an existing one, and add `@acre2` and `@CBA_A3` to the `-mod` parameter (for a longer explanation see [this tutorial](http://www.armaholic.com/forums.php?m=posts&q=20866))

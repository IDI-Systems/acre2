## Vehicle intercom

Vehicle intercom system allows for an easier communication among crew members of a vehicle that has intercom functionality. It functions just like intercom in real life vehicles, giving the crew ability to speak to each other using a headset. This allows them to communicate without the disturbance of the vehicle's noise.

## Infantry telephone

Infantry also has the possibility, in vehicles like tanks or IFVs, to communicate with the crew without entering the vehicle. To do so, face the vehicle, interact with it and take the infantry telephone if it is not in use already. You can either put it back or give it to another player.

Telephone can be mounted on the hull of the vehicle or in the center of the vehicle. If mounted on the hull (requires config support), maximum distance is 1.5m, otherwise it is 10m. The telephone will automatically be returned if the distance exceeds the maximum, either by player movement or vehicle movement.

Crew members (not passengers) can make the infantry telephone ring as long as it is not in use. In order to do so, interact with the vehicle from one of the allowed positions (driver, commander, gunner and turret positions) and select start/stop ringing. The ringing will automatically stop once the infantry telephone is picked up, the vehicle is destroyed or no crew members are aboard.

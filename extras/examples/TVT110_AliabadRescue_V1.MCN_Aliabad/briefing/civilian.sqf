	1. Mission Mechanics
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Gameplay Notes
	<br/>
	<br/>The intention of this mission is for commanders to be able to improvise quickly while still playing well. Leaders, the mission maker requests that leaders follow these guidelines:
	<br/>   - Rushing vehicles is forbidden for BOTH SIDES
	<br/>   - Blufor, please attempt to pick up the civilians in force
	<br/>   - Opfor, please consider you are supposedly defending the area while also hunting the survivors
	<br/>   - Civilians were not given maps for a reason; please do not 
	<br/>     meta-game towards the blufor spawn
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Setup and Deployment
	<br/>   
	<br/>   BLUFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>      US forces start with a standard starting area off the MSR;    movement is restricted to within this area until the mission  has started.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   OPFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>       All Russian forces start at their designated FOB in Abad. 
	<br/>   The mission commander has the option to select moving 3 of his teams to various starting locations around the map.Each starting location restricts the team from leaving the location until this mission has started. These starting locations simulate the patrols which the garrison may or may not have had outside of the FOB.The opfor commander is NOT required to use these optional starting locations.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   CIVILIANS
	<br/>   
	<br/>       The civilians will spawn off the map. Once the mission has begun (Both sides ready for 15 minute limit is reached), the random crash site is selected and the Civilians are armed, enabled and teleported to the crash site.
	<br/>
	<br/>c. Mission Start and End
	<br/>
	<br/>   Both commanders spawn in front of a map board which provides the actions to DECLARE their side as READY to begin the mission. Each commander is required to select 'READY' from their action menu on the board. All players will be alerted when a team selects they are ready. 
	<br/>
	<br/>When both teams have selected they are ready, the mission will begin and setup area restrictions are lifted.
	<br/>
	<br/>   Start Timer: The mission will automatically start 15 Minutes from exiting briefing screen regardless.
	<br/>   Mission Time Limit: The mission will automatically end as a failure for Blufor at the 2 hour mark.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   Mission End Conditions:
	<br/>      - CIVILIANS are killed (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR is considered combat ineffective at 70% casualties (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR/CIVILIANS are transported back to the blufor starting location (Blufor WIN)
	<br/>
	<br/>d. Mod Settings
	<br/>
	<br/>   CSE Medical Enabled
	<br/>      - Advanced Medical: Enabled
	<br/>      - Airways: Disabled
	<br/>      - Aidkits: Anywhere, Medic Only

	Your plane has crash landed somewhere in the area which is controlled by a garrison of Russian forces stationed out of Abad. US Forces are en route to rescue you; your team of survivors must coordinate to be rescued, while evading and fending off any Russian's attempting to capture or kill you.
	<br/>
	<br/>You have survived the crash and collected available gear in the crash to defend yourselves. You could not find any maps, but are armed consistently and have managed to find one surviving AN/PRC-343 radio already pre-programmed to US Army Standards.

	<br/>1. Enemy Forces
	<br/>  
	<br/>A Russian platoon minus is known to be holding the area. You can expect them to be immediately hunting for the crash site, hoping to kill or capture any survivors. The garrison may have units spread around the area in adjacent towns, and may have multiple vehicles at their disposal for patrolling the area.
	<br/>  
	<br/>2. Friendly Forces
	<br/>
	<br/>Before the crash, you were informed by the Pilots that a US Army platoon was being deployed for your rescue.

	1. Mission Mechanics
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Gameplay Notes
	<br/>
	<br/>The intention of this mission is for commanders to be able to improvise quickly while still playing well. Leaders, the mission maker requests that leaders follow these guidelines:
	<br/>   - Rushing vehicles is forbidden for BOTH SIDES
	<br/>   - Blufor, please attempt to pick up the civilians in force
	<br/>   - Opfor, please consider you are supposedly defending the area while also hunting the survivors
	<br/>   - Civilians were not given maps for a reason; please do not 
	<br/>     meta-game towards the blufor spawn
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Setup and Deployment
	<br/>   
	<br/>   BLUFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>      US forces start with a standard starting area off the MSR;    movement is restricted to within this area until the mission  has started.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   OPFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>       All Russian forces start at their designated FOB in Abad. 
	<br/>   The mission commander has the option to select moving 3 of his teams to various starting locations around the map.Each starting location restricts the team from leaving the location until this mission has started. These starting locations simulate the patrols which the garrison may or may not have had outside of the FOB.The opfor commander is NOT required to use these optional starting locations.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   CIVILIANS
	<br/>   
	<br/>       The civilians will spawn off the map. Once the mission has begun (Both sides ready for 15 minute limit is reached), the random crash site is selected and the Civilians are armed, enabled and teleported to the crash site.
	<br/>
	<br/>c. Mission Start and End
	<br/>
	<br/>   Both commanders spawn in front of a map board which provides the actions to DECLARE their side as READY to begin the mission. Each commander is required to select 'READY' from their action menu on the board. All players will be alerted when a team selects they are ready. 
	<br/>
	<br/>When both teams have selected they are ready, the mission will begin and setup area restrictions are lifted.
	<br/>
	<br/>   Start Timer: The mission will automatically start 15 Minutes from exiting briefing screen regardless.
	<br/>   Mission Time Limit: The mission will automatically end as a failure for Blufor at the 2 hour mark.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   Mission End Conditions:
	<br/>      - CIVILIANS are killed (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR is considered combat ineffective at 70% casualties (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR/CIVILIANS are transported back to the blufor starting location (Blufor WIN)
	<br/>

	<br/>
	<br/>1. Concept of the Operation
	<br/>
	<br/>The local garrison has received word that a C-130 will shortly crash in the are of Aliabad. The garrison is tasked with locating the crash site and killing or capturing any survivors. A US Army rescue force is expected and must be prevented from any incursion in the area.
	<br/>

	<br/>
	<br/>The garrison force is expected to continue patrolling and holding the area, while fighting off any possible US Army forces in the area. The garrison has already been actively patrolling the area prior to this alert.

	A C-130 transport aircraft has been damaged by friendly AA assets and it is expected to crash in the area shortly. The area is currently occupied by a platoon minus strength Russian garrison. Your garrison force is expected to prevent any US rescue operations in the area, while simultaneously locating the crash site and killing or capturing the survivors.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["SITUATION","
	1. Enemy Forces
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Composition:
	<br/>
	<br/>A US army company is station to the east of the area, and is expected to send a platoon sized rescue force. We can expect that their force will consist of at least a infantry platoon size unit, most likely travelling by HMMV with possible armed vehicles.
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Disposition:
	<br/>
	<br/>The US Army forces are located somewhere to the east of the area, most likely travelling into the area via the MSR.
	<br/>
	<br/>c. Strength:
	<br/>
	<br/>A platoon sized US Army infantry force is expected.
	<br/>
	<br/>d. Most Probable Course of Action
	<br/>
	<br/>The enemy will be invading the area, most likely searching for the crash site and attempting to secure any survivors of the crash. We expect them to immediately locate and secure the crash site, and then attempt to take any survivors back to the east to US territory.
	<br/>
	<br/>e. Most Dangerous Course of Action
	<br/>
	<br/>The US force will out number the garrison units stationed in the area, and may be approaching with armed HMMVs. If this is the case, they may have sufficient force to overpower the garrison in a fair engagement.
	<br/>
	<br/>2. Friendly Forces
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Composition:
	<br/>   Force:
	<br/>       4 teams of 5 men each, russian regulars. Each team consists of a team leader, 2 x Rifleman, 1 RPG and 1 x PKP.
	<br/>		2 x DSHkm 3-man Teams
	<br/>		1 x HQ element with 2 medics
	<br/>		Supplies avialable in the UAZ vehicles

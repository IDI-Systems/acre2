	1. Mission Mechanics
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Gameplay Notes
	<br/>
	<br/>The intention of this mission is for commanders to be able to improvise quickly while still playing well. Leaders, the mission maker requests that leaders follow these guidelines:
	<br/>   - Rushing vehicles is forbidden for BOTH SIDES
	<br/>   - Blufor, please attempt to pick up the civilians in force
	<br/>   - Opfor, please consider you are supposedly defending the area while also hunting the survivors
	<br/>   - Civilians were not given maps for a reason; please do not 
	<br/>     meta-game towards the blufor spawn
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Setup and Deployment
	<br/>   
	<br/>   BLUFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>      US forces start with a standard starting area off the MSR;    movement is restricted to within this area until the mission  has started.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   OPFOR
	<br/>   
	<br/>       All Russian forces start at their designated FOB in Abad. 
	<br/>   The mission commander has the option to select moving 3 of his teams to various starting locations around the map.Each starting location restricts the team from leaving the location until this mission has started. These starting locations simulate the patrols which the garrison may or may not have had outside of the FOB.The opfor commander is NOT required to use these optional starting locations.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   CIVILIANS
	<br/>   
	<br/>       The civilians will spawn off the map. Once the mission has begun (Both sides ready for 15 minute limit is reached), the random crash site is selected and the Civilians are armed, enabled and teleported to the crash site.
	<br/>
	<br/>c. Mission Start and End
	<br/>
	<br/>   Both commanders spawn in front of a map board which provides the actions to DECLARE their side as READY to begin the mission. Each commander is required to select 'READY' from their action menu on the board. All players will be alerted when a team selects they are ready. 
	<br/>
	<br/>When both teams have selected they are ready, the mission will begin and setup area restrictions are lifted.
	<br/>
	<br/>   Start Timer: The mission will automatically start 15 Minutes from exiting briefing screen regardless.
	<br/>   Mission Time Limit: The mission will automatically end as a failure for Blufor at the 2 hour mark.
	<br/>   
	<br/>   Mission End Conditions:
	<br/>      - CIVILIANS are killed (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR is considered combat ineffective at 70% casualties (Opfor WIN)
	<br/>      - BLUFOR/CIVILIANS are transported back to the blufor starting location (Blufor WIN)
	<br/>
	<br/>d. Mod Settings
	<br/>
	<br/>   CSE Medical Enabled
	<br/>      - Advanced Medical: Enabled
	<br/>      - Airways: Disabled
	<br/>      - Aidkits: Anywhere, Medic Only

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["SITUATION","
	1. Enemy Forces
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Composition:
	<br/>
	<br/>Intelligence gathered in the area has determined that a Russian platoon has been garrisoned in the area; expect trained Russian Infantry who have experience in the area. This force has been known to be lightly supplied, so vehicles may be possible but no force multipliers are known to exist in the area at this time. Multiple unarmed UAZ's have been spotted in the area. The force consists of Russian regulars, wearing standard gear.
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Disposition:
	<br/>
	<br/>Command has determined that the main force is garrisoned in the town of Abad. However, satellite patrol forces should be expected given to the Russian involvement in the area. Be warry of possible defensive positions or weapons such as heavy weapons emplacements.
	<br/>
	<br/>c. Strength:
	<br/>
	<br/>A company minus force of approximately 25 Russians is expected in the area. 
	<br/>
	<br/>d. Most Probable Course of Action
	<br/>
	<br/>Higher is confident that the Russian forces in the area will attempt to locate the crash site, move in force, and kill or capture the survivors of the area.
	<br/>
	<br/>e. Most Dangerous Course of Action
	<br/>
	<br/>There is a high risk that Russian patrols will exist scattered throughout the area, creating a scenario where small russian forces may block your advance in the area with RPG or small arms fire.
	<br/>
	<br/>2. Friendly Forces
	<br/>
	<br/>a. Composition:
	<br/>   Force:
	<br/>       Single Army infantry company minus with standard equipment.       
	<br/>
	<br/>   Vehicle:
	<br/>       5 x HMMV with mounted M2 Machinegun
	<br/>       6 x HMMV 9-seater covered
	<br/>
	<br/>b. Supporting Fires:
	<br/>
	<br/>None available at this time.
	<br/>
	<br/>3. Attachments and Detachments
	<br/>
	<br/>None available at this time.

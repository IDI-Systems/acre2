# Reporting an issue

## Before reporting

If you have found an issue with ACRE2 please make sure that ACRE2 really is the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `@CBA_A3` and `@acre2` on a newly created mission.

Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.

**Please note:**
- It's not a valid to simply remove <code>@acre2</code> from the mod list to confirm that ACRE2 is the culprit.
- If the error happens when using a <b>third-party mod</b> contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.

## Reporting the issue

Head over to the [ACRE2 GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2/issues) and press the [New issue](https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2/issues/new) button in the top right corner. Add a descriptive title and complete the issue template.

A video of the issue might be helpful in resolving it faster.


# Feature Requests

## Background

ACRE2 has a lot of features planned. However, due to time constraints, we have managed to finish only a fraction of the job so far.

## Requesting a feature

In order to avoid duplicates and keep the issue tracker organized, we have created a common issue for [ACE3 Feature requests](https://github.com/IDI-Systems/acre2/issues/?). Any and all relevant requests should be submitted there, where they will also get discussed and evaluated. Before adding a new one, make sure to check the previous entries from the thread and do a quick search for similar suggestions; please don't reiterate requests for features that had already been accepted for inclusion, or those which were disregarded earlier.

Following their approval, feature requests may be moved by moderators to a separate issue for further discussion.
